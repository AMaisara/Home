			<p>Cubism was a movement that was pioneered by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque in the early 1900s. Cubists believed that art should not have to copy nature and started to move away from traditional techniques and styles by creating pieces that involved objects which were composed of many different geometric shapes. One characteristic of artworks that came from the cubist movement were the flattened shapes. The works would have almost no depth and would use minimal shading. The most unique characteristic of cubist works though, was how the artists would show multiple perspectives of the same object at once. Cubism was a movement driven by artists of the early 20th century wanting to push the boundaries of what was considered art, which in the end, became the most important artistic movement of the 20th century, since it laid the foundation for all future forms of abstract art.</p>
