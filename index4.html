		<p>The Baroque art movement started out in Rome in the 17th century while Rococo started out in Paris in the 18th century. Despite the two movements originating in two different centuries and locations, the two share one thing in common, and that is its main characterization. Baroque and Rococo are both characterized by one thing; grandeur. They do, however, have their fair share of differences. While Baroque artists focused mainly on the church, Rococo artists chose to focus on the lives of the French upper middle class. Stylistically speaking, they also differed greatly. Baroque art was characterized by its dramatic use of hidden lighting and contrasting colours. Rococo artists on the other hand, used soft, pastel colours and scattered lighting. The Rococo movement emerged during the <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Age_of_Enlightenment">period of enlightenment</a>, which was when Europeans started favoring reason over religion. Baroque, on the other hand, came almost right after the renaissance, which meant that it was the first art movement of the new modern age. Since it was the first movement of the modern age, Baroque artists were perhaps the first artists that were able to stray away from the restrictions of the Medieval period, which may be why artists in this period started painting pieces with an aura of grandeur.</p>
