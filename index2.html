			<p>Ancient art is any piece of art created by civilizations in between 30,000 B.C. and 400 A.D. However, civilizations with established writing systems were typically the ones that produced the most art. Art from this time period had similar purposes. Many pieces of art told either religious or cultural stories, while other pieces were simply created for decorative purposes. In some civilizations, such as ancient Egypt, art was used to depict social orders and social classes. One of the most famous works of ancient art dates back to about 18th century B.C. and comes from Mesopotamia. This piece is known as the "Code of Hammurabi" and shows a set of Babylonian laws resting underneath the 6th King of Babylonia (King Hammurabi) and the Mesopotamian god, Shabash. </p>

			<p>Religion was the focal point of Medieval art, whether it came from the east or the west, there was always some sort of religious imagery present within Medieval art pieces. The Medieval times were also sometimes referred to as the "Dark Ages". It was nicknamed this because of the fact that this period was a time of cultural/economic deterioration, due to the fall of the Roman Empire. The works that were produced during this time period reflected this darkness by using grotesque and gothic imagery. This period/movement was also responsible for the creation and rise of the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/getty-museum/getty-manuscripts/a/what-is-an-illuminated-manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> and <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-gothic-architecture.html">gothic architecture</a>.</p>
