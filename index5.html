			<p>Impressionism is often considered the first "modern art" movement. Impressionism's goal was to show the world what the artist was seeing. Instead of painting a realistic portrait of the object/person/landscape, impressionist artists would instead paint the "impression". Impressionist artwork was characterized by its choppy brushwork, which was used to make it seem as though the paintings were moving. Another common characteristic would be how the closer you'd get to an impressionist painting, the more it'd start looking like an incomprehensible mess. Take a few steps back, and suddenly a beautiful painting takes the place of what you once thought was a mess of different colours. Impressionism was also unique due to the fact that unlike previous art movements and styles that would display anything that was grand, impressionism would focus on the lives of the middle and working class. By choosing to portray the day-to-day lives of normal people, impressionism managed to set itself apart from the movements that had come before it while also creating a blueprint for many art movements that would come after it.</p>
