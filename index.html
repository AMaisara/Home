		<p>Art is a medium of expression. Through art, you can express your emotions, desires, and intuitions. There are many forms of art such as music, drama, dance, etc. For some reason though, whenever we, as a society, think of art, we think of the visual arts. This may be due to the fact that the visual arts are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art">oldest documented art form.</a> This page explores how the definition of what is "good" art has changed throughout history and also how the visual arts have evolved stylistically.</p>

		<p>Art movements occur when a group of artists start following a certain style of art with one common philosophy/ideolody in mind. Art movements are typically a reflection of the state of the world at the time the movement had occurred. Many art movements occur during times of great change and/or distress. This may be due to the fact that art can sometimes fuel change in society. One example of this would be the <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm">femnist art movement</a>, which played a huge role in the feminist movement that occured in the 1970s. In summary, by studying art movements you can gain a better understanding of what society was like when the movement occurred and how art can influence and change the world.</p>
