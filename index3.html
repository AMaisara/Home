			<p>The renaissance is considered a turning point in history, since it marked the beginning of the European age of exploration, which eventually led to the Europeans colonising many parts of the world. It is also referred to as the transition period between the Medieval ages and modernity. During this time period, European interest in the arts were reborn, and due to the sudden burst in economic activity, artists became more active. Renaissance artists focused on the philosophies of individualism and humanism, and displayed these ideologies through their work. Artwork created during the renaissance is often characterized by realism, use of linear perspective, and exaggerated use of lighting/shading.</p>
