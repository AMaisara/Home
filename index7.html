			<p>Surrealists and their ideologies were influenced by the works of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>. The purpose of surrealism was to ceate works of art that defied reason and went against the rationalist mind. Surrealists believed that the reationalist mindset was surpressing imaginative thought and limiting creativity. Surrealism emerged from Dadaism, which was an art movement that emerged in response to the horrors of World War I, and considered themselves to be "anti-art". Dadaism was meant to be meaningless and absurd. In summary, dadaism was an art movement that was basically mocking art. Surrealism differs from dadaism due to the fact that surrealists take their art very seriously and do see themselves as artists. Surrealist artists would focus on the unconscious mind rather than the conscious one, in search of a deeper meaning behind their actions. Surrealist art is characterized by its depiction of dreamlike and bizarre images.</p>
